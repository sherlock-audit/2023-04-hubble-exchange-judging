# getUnderlyingPrice may return stale data

# Oracle#getUnderlyingPrice may return stale data

## Summary

getUnderlyingPrice makes the AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData() subcall but only validates the price. It doesn't validate when price was last updated. Chainlink oracle have a built in heartbeat and data that has been updated outside of this window is stale and cannot be trusted.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Oracle.sol#L24-L36](https://github.com/hubble-exchange/hubble-protocol/blob/d89714101dd3494b132a3e3f9fed9aca4e19aef6/contracts/Oracle.sol#L24-L36)

    function getUnderlyingPrice(address underlying)
        virtual
        external
        view
        returns(int256 answer)
    {
        if (stablePrice[underlying] != 0) {
            return stablePrice[underlying];
        }
        (,answer,,,) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();
        require(answer > 0, "Oracle.getUnderlyingPrice.non_positive");
        answer /= 100;
    }

The above lines never validate when the price was last updated allowing for it to use stale data. Using outdated price data can lead to over borrowing or unfair liquidation.

## Impact

Contract can consume outdated information leading to incorrect prices

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Validate the update time to make sure it is within the heartbeat period.
